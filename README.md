```

# Explanation

## What is FFI? 
Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is a mechanism that allows a program written in one language to call routines or utilize services written or compiled in another language.

## Overview
In this project, a simple function is implemented to demonstrate how Rust can interact with data types defined in C. This function prints the data types, showcasing how they can be interpreted and used by a Rust function.

## Further Understanding
Refer to the code for a deeper understanding of how the interaction between Rust and C is achieved.
